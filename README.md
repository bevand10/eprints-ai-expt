# EPrints AI experiments

Currently this project only contains one experiment. If you add this file to your EPrints config and configure appropriately, and the keywords field is blank, EPrints will ask Azure Cognitive Services for keywords based on Abstract text. Further information is available here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/ and in the comments of the file. 

You will need an Azure API key. You can obtain a seven day key from here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/ or you can sign up for an Azure trail account. If your institution uses Office 365, you might want to check that the API trial is against your own MS account.

Have fun!
